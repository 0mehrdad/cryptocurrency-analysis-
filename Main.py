# Intelligent Coin Trading (ICT)
## Welcome to ICT!ðŸª™ 


This is a simple application to visualise and analyse cryptocurrency data.  
There are four groups of crypto available, each with one coin as an example:  
1. Zcash (ZEC)    
2. Monero (XMR)  
3. Litecoin (LTC)  
4. Axie Infinity Shards (AXS)


You can choose any of the four coins for EDA and forecasting using four different ML models.


For EDA, you can visualise line charts, moving averages, etc., on the EDA page.  
You can also visualise the correlation between the features with a heatmap on the Correlation page.


For forecasting, you can choose any of the four ML models: ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, and LSTM.  
You can get forecasts for 7, 14, and 30 days, along with buy and sell signals (Model page).  
Additionally, you can use two more advanced deep learning models (N-BEATS and Transformer) on the Models Extra page.
